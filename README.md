# CSUGlobalStuff
This is a collection of my Assignments and Projects for my CS degree at CSU Gloabal.

The folders are broken into semesters containing 1-3 classes which each have at most 8 projects. The classes will mostly have a portfolio project that showcases a lot of the lessons that were taught in that class.

All of these semesters were a part of online classes that I have been doing for the past 2 years.

Some of the semesters are missing because I either forgot to save the code, or it was semester of papers.

## Semester 1
This one is light becasue it was a lot of pseudo-code

## Semester 3

## Semester 4

## Semester 5

## Semester 8

## Semester 9

This semester was all about a capstone project. This porject has its own repo on my git hub.
