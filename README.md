# CSUGlobalStuff
This is a collection of my Assignments and Projects for my CS degree at CSU Gloabal.

The folders are broken into semesters containing 1-3 classes which each have at most 8 projects. The classes will mostly have a portfolio project that showcases a lot of the lessons that were taught in that class.

All of these semesters were a part of online classes that I have been doing for the past 2 years.

Some of the semesters are missing because I either forgot to save the code, or it was semester of papers.

## Semester 1
This one is light becasue it was a lot of pseudo-code. Also it is just some basic JavaScript.

## Semester 3
This is where I start getting into some Java

[**This is the portfolio project for this semster.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/blob/main/Semester3/Portfolio/CSC320PortfolioProject.java)

I this project I use java to make a car dealrship app.

## Semester 4
[**One of the Highlights here is this project that has a couple of sorting algorithims in Java.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/tree/main/Semester4/CSC372/module6)

[**Here is another Sorting method in Java.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/tree/main/Semester4/CSC400/module6)

## Semester 5
This semester was less about actually coding, and more about coding concepts. Like below there are some examples of multi-threading


[**Multi-Threading Java.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/blob/main/semester5/CSC450/PortfolioProject/multithreading.java)

[**Multi-Threading C++.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/blob/main/semester5/CSC450/PortfolioMilestone/multithreading.cpp)


## Semester 8
This semseter was about WebGL and other computer graphics.

[**Here is a spining globe in WebGL.**](https://github.com/Jeffordsmp/CSUGlobalStuff/tree/main/semester8/spiningSphere)

## Semester 9

This semester was all about a capstone project. This porject has its own repo on my git hub.
